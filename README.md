# update_ExifTool
A bash script to update ExifTool automatically

    This is a bash script intends to download and update the files of 
ExifTool automatically for Mac OS, I think it will work on GNU/Linux too,
because most of the commands are GNU versions.
    This is my first 'long' bash script. I am still learning, you're 
welcome to leave the advices and suggestions.
